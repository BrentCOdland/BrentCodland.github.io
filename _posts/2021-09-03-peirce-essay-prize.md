## Peirce's 3vl Logic and my essay prize

October last year (2020), I found out that I won the Charles S. Peirce essay prize for a paper I drew out of my master's thesis on Peirce's three valued logic at the University of Calgary. My supervisor was Mark Migotti and my unofficial co-supervisor was Richard Zach for this project.

I am very excited to say that the paper will be published in the fall by the __Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society__. I will update this page with details for finding the paper when I learn them. You can find the draft of the essay I submitted to the competition under the Drafts tab in the meantime, should anyone wish.
